    "# Greetings\n",
    "In this project, we tackle the challenges associated with analyzing real-world and messy datasets. Recognizing the inherent difficulties in seamlessly transitioning from hypothesis formulation to data analysis, this work emphasizes the importance of data cleaning, reshaping, and tidying as foundational steps in the analytical process. By applying Data Wrangling techniques and Quality methods, we aim to uncover patterns and insights, despite the noisy and incomplete nature of the data. This analysis not only highlights the relationships and trends within the dataset but also demonstrates the ability to effectively manage and interpret unstructured data, ultimately supporting informed decision-making. This projet will be based on this quantitative analysis of [data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-2016/) resulting from anonymous surveys from people working in IT-related companies around the world."
