# Tidying up data
In a world where data is the new oil, it is important to ensure that the data is clean, the data is tidy, and the data 
is ready for analysis. This project is a collection of scripts that help in tidying up data. 

## About the project

In this project, we tackle the challenges associated with analyzing real-world and messy datasets. Recognizing the 
inherent difficulties in seamlessly transitioning from hypothesis formulation to data analysis, this work emphasizes the
importance of data cleaning, reshaping, and tidying as foundational steps in the analytical process. By applying Data 
Wrangling techniques and Quality methods, we aim to uncover patterns and insights, despite the noisy and incomplete 
nature of the data. This analysis not only highlights the relationships and trends within the dataset but also 
demonstrates the ability to effectively manage and interpret unstructured data, ultimately supporting informed 
decision-making. This project will be based on this quantitative analysis 
of [data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-2016/) resulting from anonymous surveys from 
people working in IT-related companies around the world.


## Why ?
Using Data Wrangling techniques and Quality methods allows us to uncover hidden patterns and trends, even in noisy 
datasets. The ability to manage and interpret unstructured data is crucial for deriving insights that support informed 
decision-making. Through the analysis of anonymous survey data from IT professionals worldwide, this project 
demonstrates the practical application of these techniques in a real-world context.
