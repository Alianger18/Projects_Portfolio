# Mental Health Data Analysis for HR

## What is it?

This project aims to support the Human Resources (HR) department in mitigating mental health issues among company staff 
through quantitative analyses of survey data. The provided survey results, representative of the company's 
technology-oriented employees, present challenges due to their high dimensionality, complexity, and issues like missing 
values and non-standardized textual inputs.

Our goal is to allow HR to gain actionable insights and identify potential leverage points for targeted interventions 
aimed at improving mental health within the organization.

## Why?

Mental health is a critical aspect of overall well-being and productivity, especially in a high-stress, 
technology-oriented work environment. Addressing mental health issues proactively can lead to numerous benefits, 
including:

- **Improved Employee Well-being:** By identifying and addressing mental health issues early, the company can enhance the overall well-being of its employees.
- **Increased Productivity:** Employees with good mental health are more productive, creative, and engaged in their work.
- **Enhanced Workplace Environment:** Promoting mental health can lead to a more supportive and positive workplace culture.
- **Retention and Recruitment:** A company that prioritizes mental health can attract and retain top talent, demonstrating a commitment to employee welfare.

By providing HR with a detailed and actionable analysis of the survey data, this project enables the development of
targeted interventions that can significantly improve the mental health landscape within the organization.
